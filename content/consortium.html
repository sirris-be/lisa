  Sirris, funded by the VLAIO Collective Research & Development and Collective
  Knowledge Dissemination / Transfer (COOCK) program. COOCK projects focus on a
  group of companies, with the aim of valorising (basic) research results by
  accelerating the introduction of technology and/or knowledge.

      DistriNet is a KU Leuven research group embedded in the Department of
      Computer Science, and is part of the imec-KU Leuven Security and Privacy
      Center. The scope of DistriNet’s research is twofold: ICT security with an
      emphasis on secure software, secure systems, and software engineering for
      security, and distributed systems. DistriNet’s knowledge and expertise in
      these domains resulted in a strong international position in the domains
      of secure software, systems and services, and in security & privacy
      engineering.
