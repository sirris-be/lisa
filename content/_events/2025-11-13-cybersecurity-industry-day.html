<h3>Boosting cybersecurity research, together</h3>

<p>
  On November 13, researchers, industry experts, entrepreneurs, innovators and
  policy makers meet up to accelerate progress in cybersecurity.
</p>

<p>
  Academic research on cybersecurity is strongly committed to real-world impact,
  not in isolation, but through close collaborations with business and society.
  These partnerships spark fresh insights, deliver practical applications, and
  help set the right priorities for the cybersecurity agenda of tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
  This event is all about bridging the gap between university and industry.
  Expect thought-provoking keynotes from cybersecurity experts, real-world
  success stories of research valorization, and plenty of opportunities to
  connect and exchange ideas.
