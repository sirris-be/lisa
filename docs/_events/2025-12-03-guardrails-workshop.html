<p>
  In this workshop, participants will get hands-on experience both building and
  breaking AI guardrails.
</p>

<p>
  Working in teams, you’ll design guardrail policies to defend sensitive data
  within a vulnerable AI application, while attempting to bypass those of
  others.
</p>

<p>
  Who will win? The scoreboard will tell, but in the end everyone walks away
  with a deeper grasp of how LLMs can be manipulated and the challenges of
  building robust guardrails.
